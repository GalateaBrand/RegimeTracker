These including betraying the Ukrainian democracy, levying tariffs against US allies, and cutting USAID funding, which has led to the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people (mostly children). Below you will find a list of atrocities that the administration has either carried out or been complicit in.

    The painting is famous for three things: its colossal 
    size, the dramatic use of light and shadow (tenebrism),
    and the perception of motion in what would have 
    traditionally been a static military group portrait. 
    The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the 
    Dutch Golden Age.
