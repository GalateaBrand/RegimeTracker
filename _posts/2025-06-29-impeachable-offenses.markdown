description: Donald Trump began committing various illegal and clearly impeachable offenses immediately upon taking office for a second term. And let us not forget he was twice impeached during his first term. The fact that Congress has failed to carry out its constitutional duty to remove Trump from office does not make it any less obvious to any reasonable observer that his actions are clearly demonstrate that he is unfit to hold the position of President. Below you will find a list of specific examples of impeachable offenses that, under any semblance of reasonable circumstances, would warrant conviction and removal from office.
